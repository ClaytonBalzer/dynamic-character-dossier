# dynamic-character-dossier
5E version
This is the beginning of my dynamic character sheet for 5th Edition Dungeouns and dragons, hopefully I will be able to intergrate this to other roleplaying systems. This is also my first project of GitHub as well as a my sample program in Web Dev and Software Dev.
